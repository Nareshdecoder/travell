              The website’s interface is also easy to use. On the home page,
              search for a hotel by entering your chosen destination and dates.
              Then, use the extensive list of filters—such as price range and
              distance from the city center—to narrow the results down and find
              the best fit.

              You can also search for a specific hotel, or seek inspiration by
              clicking through options grouped by destination or property type
              or by topic such as the country’s best Michelin-starred hotel
              restaurants or the top cities for vegan travelers. The flights,
              car rental, and other tabs are just as intuitive.
